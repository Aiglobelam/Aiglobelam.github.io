// Controlled component
// FORMS:
//   Instead of going into the DOM and grab the value...
//   Bind value of the input field, to whatever the property on the state object is...
//   Sounds backwards, typically inputfield input updates state...
//   Bind input field to whatever the state value is, so whenever you update the state
//   the value in the input field is going to change.
//   Controlled component: REACT is CONTROLLING the value of the specific input field

// Un controlled component
// Instead of binding the input value in the form field to the state,
// When user clicks commit, you "grab" value from the DOM and commit/set state
